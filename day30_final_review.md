### Sample Answers to Common Questions:

#### Q: "Explain overfitting"
**Answer**: 
"Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise rather than underlying patterns. This results in excellent training performance but poor generalization to new data.

**Causes**: 
- Model too complex relative to data size
- Insufficient regularization
- Training for too long

**Detection**:
- Large gap between train/validation error
- Cross-validation performance varies significantly

**Solutions**:
- Regularization (L1/L2)
- Early stopping
- More training data
- Simpler model architecture
- Cross-validation"

#### Q: "How do you handle missing data?"
**Answer**:
"Several strategies depending on the situation:

**1. Analysis First**:
- Understand why data is missing (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)
- Assess the extent and pattern

**2. Deletion Methods**:
- Listwise deletion: Remove rows with any missing values
- Pairwise deletion: Use available data for each analysis
- When to use: < 5% missing, MCAR

**3. Imputation Methods**:
- Simple: Mean/median/mode
- Advanced: KNN imputation, regression imputation
- Multiple imputation for uncertainty quantification

**4. Model-based**:
- Use algorithms that handle missing values (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Create 'missing' indicator features

**5. Domain-specific**:
- Forward fill (time series)
- Interpolation methods"
